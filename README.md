# Project Overview

In this project, I've gained knowledge and implemented various aspects of Next.js 13, a powerful React framework for building web applications. Below is a summary of what I've learned and implemented:

## Folder Structure

I've structured the project using Next.js 13's recommended folder structure, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

## Client and Server Components

I've explored the concept of Client Components and Server Components in Next.js 13, understanding when to use each for efficient rendering.

## File-based Routing

I've leveraged Next.js 13's file-based routing system, including dynamic and nested routes, to create a user-friendly navigation structure.

## Special Files

I've utilized Next.js 13's special files like `pages`, `layout`, `loading`, and `error` to handle various aspects of the application's behavior and user experience.

## Serverless Route Handlers

I've implemented serverless route handlers using Next.js 13's API functionality, enabling the development of full-stack applications with ease.

## Metadata and SEO

I've focused on optimizing metadata and improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the application, ensuring better discoverability on search engines.

## Data Fetching

I've learned and applied three key methods for data fetching in Next.js:

1. **Server Side Rendering (SSR):** Rendering content on the server side for faster initial page loads and improved SEO.

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generating static HTML files at build time for improved performance and reduced server load.

3. **Incremental Static Generation (ISR):** Generating and updating static content incrementally as needed, ensuring up-to-date data without compromising performance.

## Google Authentication

I've implemented Google authentication in the application, allowing users to securely log in using their Google accounts.
